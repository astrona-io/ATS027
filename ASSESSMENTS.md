# Reusable Question Banks

`assessments/index.yaml` lists banks in teaching order. Each bank uses schema
version 1 and the contract in `schemas/question-bank.schema.json`. This is an
authoring format for future application integration, not an existing Astrona
quiz API. No YAML question file is registered as a Markdown reading.

Each section bank follows that section's final module summary. The domain bank
follows the final section bank. Banks contain 5–15 original single-choice
questions, scoped to concepts taught in the course. They remain draft for review.

## Fields And Rendering

- `id`: stable bank or question identity; preserve it when editing wording.
- `scope`: section or domain checkpoint.
- `placement`: relative reading path after which the checkpoint belongs.
- `learning_objective`: the measurable outcome checked by the question.
- `source_readings`: author traceability to the teaching; not learner navigation.
- `prompt`: learner-visible question text.
- `options`: stable option IDs, answer text and per-option feedback.
- `correct_option`: the ID of the single correct option.
- `explanation`: feedback reinforcing the supported answer.

The application should send only the question ID, prompt and option IDs/text to
the learner before submission. Keep `correct_option`, `explanation` and option
explanations on the server until feedback is permitted. Match answers by option
ID, not display position, so a later renderer can shuffle choices safely.

The banks contain answer keys and are public learning material, so this is not
a secure examination bank. Do not treat scores as an official CKAD result.

## Graded Lab Expansion

Every active module includes a draft independent graded lab. This course has 8 active graded labs, registered after the readings they practise. Each has its own cluster, task, solution, context guards, reference repair and behavior grader. Static and offline checks pass. Live verification remains pending because the authoring session cannot access the Podman socket. The installed CLI's configuration validator is separately blocked by its local-state maintenance lock.
